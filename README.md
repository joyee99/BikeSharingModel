# Boom Bike Sharing Model

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Table of Contents
* Used Multiple Linear Regression Model.
* Multiple Libraries used from Python 
	1. Numpy (to operate multiple numerical action on data.)
	2. Pandas (load the data, read the data and for EDA)
	3. Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
	4. sklearn (it is a library for Machine Learning)
	5. statsmodel (to create VIF and building Regression model)
	6. warnings (for handling warnings)
* We concluded that the Linear regressin Model perfectly fit for this business problem which is stated in Step: 19 and 20.


## General Information
- This is an assignment wherein a multiple linear regression model is built to predict demand for shared bikes depending on the current trend.

  This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
  
- Business Goal:
	We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
	
- Business Problem from Client:
	1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
	2. How well those variables describe the bike demands?
